# Fire-Alert-System
Problem Statement: 

Fire accidents frequently occur in industrial setups with flammable materials, electrical gadgets, or complicated machinery. Such setups increase the chances of ignition source meeting with combustible materials resulting in disastrous incidents. Given the convoluted and numerous industrial operations, fire can spread very fast, thus, early detection and prompt responses are needed to mitigate as much damage as possible. Hence the need arises for a reliable automated prototype that would guarantee rapid detection of fire incidents and aid in safe and orderly evacuation of workers with a view to minimizing injury, loss of life, and property damage.

Scope of the Solution: 

The outline solution intends to:

Detect fire accidents automatically at an industrial setup using sensors.
Raise immediate alerts using LED lights, buzzers, and relays of other alerting devices or pumps, for instance.
Help in evacuating by automatically directing workers along clear signals.
Present the system as a working prototype based on microcontrollers so that it can be further implemented as a comprehensive industrial safety system.
Include provisions for documentation, simulation, and codes for reproduction and further improvements.

Required Components: 

Hardware:

Arduino UNO (microcontroller board)
Temperature Sensor (LM35, analog, -55°C to 150°C, accuracy ±0.5°C)
Gas Sensor (MQ-2 detects LPG, smoke, methane, CO, alcohol; analog output, 5V)
Buzzer (5V active)
Relay module (5V, single channel)
LED (5mm red, for visual alert)
220Ω resistor (for LED current limiting)
Breadboard (for prototyping)
Jumper wires  

Software:

Arduino IDE (for coding and uploading firmware)
TinkerCad (for circuit simulation and diagram)
EasyEDA (for PCB design and Gerber file generation)

Result:
A working fire management system which detects fire with the help of the temperature sensor and gas sensor.
