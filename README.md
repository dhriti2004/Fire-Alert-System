# Fire-Alert-System

Aim: 
This project aims to design and develop an industrial fire safety system capable of detecting hazardous conditions, namely abnormal temperature rise and the presence of flammable gases. The system is designed to give prompt audio and visual alarms to speed up worker evacuation, thus avoiding injury and loss of life, as well as damage or destruction of property. The prototype demonstrates an economical yet dependable way for industrial fire safety by way of microcontroller technology (Arduino Nano), along with temperature and gas sensors, and a simple alarm system consisting of buzzers and LEDs. 

Result: 
The prototype implemented monitors the environment for high temperatures and concentrations of hazardous gases through the LM35 type temperature sensor and an MQ-2 gas sensor. Whenever these sensors measure values above a certain safety threshold for temperature, say temperature above 50Â°C, or alternatively, gas concentration above a fixed analog value, in these instances, the system would immediately activate the buzzer as well as the LED to notify the personnel of an existence of a hazard. The system is responsive and can be easily put together; for more complex requirements in industrial safety, the system may be further customized or scaled. Testing has proved a flawless performance from the prototype where it never sounded alerts in non-hazardous situations, thereby providing a real-time manifestation of the automated detection of fire and gas leakage for industries.
